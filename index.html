    <title>The Mystery of Sexual Transformation by Napoleon Hill (Chapter 11 of Think and Grow Rich)</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Think and Grow Rich: Chapter 11. The Mystery of Sex Transmutation (The Tenth Step toward Riches)</h1>
    <p>THE meaning of the word "transmute" is, in simple language, "the changing, or transferring of one element, or
        form of energy, into another."</p>
    <p>The emotion of sex brings into being a state of mind.</p>
    <p>Because of ignorance on the subject, this state of mind is generally associated with the physical, and because of
        improper influences, to which most people have been subjected, in acquiring knowledge of sex, things essentially
        physical have highly biased the mind.</p>
    <p>The emotion of sex has back of it the possibility of three constructive potentialities, they are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The perpetuation of mankind.</li>
        <li>The maintenance of health, (as a therapeutic agency, it has no equal).</li>
        <li>The transformation of mediocrity into genius through transmutation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Sex transmutation is simple and easily explained. It means the switching of the mind from thoughts of physical
        expression, to thoughts of some other nature.</p>
    <p>Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires.</p>
    <p>When driven by this desire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, will-power, persistence, and creative
        ability unknown to them at other times. So strong and impelling is the desire for sexual contact that men freely
        run the risk of life and reputation to indulge it. When harnessed, and redirected along other lines, this
        motivating force maintains all of its attributes of keenness of imagination, courage, etc., which may be used as
        powerful creative forces in literature, art, or in any other profession or calling, including, of course, the
        accumulation of riches.</p>
    <p>The transmutation of sex energy calls for the exercise of will-power, to be sure, but the reward is worth the
        effort. The desire for sexual expression is inborn and natural. The desire cannot, and should not be submerged
        or eliminated. But it should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body, mind, and
        spirit of man. If not given this form of outlet, through transmutation, it will seek outlets through purely
        physical channels. </p>
    <p>A river may be dammed, and its water controlled for a time, but eventually, it will force an outlet. The same is
        true of the emotion of sex. It may be submerged and controlled for a time, but its very nature causes it to be
        ever seeking means of expression. If it is not transmuted into some creative effort it will find a less worthy
        outlet. </p>
    <p>Fortunate, indeed, is the person who has discovered how to give sex emotion an outlet through some form of
        creative effort, for he has, by that discovery, lifted himself to the status of a genius.</p>
    <p>Scientific research has disclosed these significant facts:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The men of greatest achievement are men with highly developed sex natures; men who have learned the art of
            sex transmutation.</li>
        <li>The men who have accumulated great fortunes and achieved outstanding recognition in literature, art,
            industry, architecture, and the professions, were motivated by the influence of a woman.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The research from which these astounding discoveries were made, went back through the pages of biography and
        history for more than two thousand years. Wherever there was evidence available in connection with the lives of
        men and women of great achievement, it indicated most convincingly that they possessed highly developed sex
        natures.</p>
    <p>The emotion of sex is an "irresistible force," against which there can be no such opposition as an "immovable
        body." When driven by this emotion, men become gifted with a super power for action. Understand this truth, and
        you will catch the significance of the statement that sex transmutation will lift one to the status of a genius.
    </p>
    <p>The emotion of sex contains the secret of creative ability.</p>
    <p>Destroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed the major source of action. For proof of
        this, observe what happens to any animal after it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a cow after it
        has been altered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the male, whether man or beast, all the FIGHT that was in
        him. Sex alteration of the female has the same effect.</p>
    <h2>THE TEN MIND STIMULI</h2>
    <p>The human mind responds to stimuli, through which it may be "keyed up" to high rates of vibration, known as
        enthusiasm, creative imagination, intense desire, etc. The stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The desire for sex expression.</li>
        <li>Love.</li>
        <li>A burning desire for fame, power, or financial gain, MONEY.</li>
        <li>Music.</li>
        <li>Friendship between either those of the same sex, or those of the opposite sex.</li>
        <li>A Master Mind alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or
            temporal advancement.</li>
        <li>Mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted.</li>
        <li>Auto-suggestion.</li>
        <li>Fear.</li>
        <li>Narcotics and alcohol.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The desire for sex expression comes at the head of the list of stimuli, which most effectively "step-up" the
        vibrations of the mind and start the "wheels" of physical action. Eight of these stimuli are natural and
        constructive. Two are destructive. The list is here presented for the purpose of enabling you to make a
        comparative study of the major sources of mind stimulation. From this study, it will be readily seen that the
        emotion of sex is, by great odds, the most intense and powerful of all mind stimuli.</p>
    <p>This comparison is necessary as a foundation for proof of the statement that transmutation of sex energy may lift
        one to the status of a genius. Let us find out what constitutes a genius.</p>
    <p>Some wiseacre has said that a genius is a man who "wears long hair, eats queer food, lives alone, and serves as a
        target for the joke makers." A better definition of a genius is, "a man who has discovered how to increase the
        vibrations of thought to the point where he can freely communicate with sources of knowledge not available
        through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought."</p>
    <p>The person who thinks will want to ask some questions concerning this definition of genius. The first question
        will be, "How may one communicate with sources of knowledge which are not available through the ORDINARY rate of
        vibration of thought?"</p>
    <p>The next question will be, "Are there known sources of knowledge which are available only to genii, and if so,
        WHAT ARE THESE SOURCES, and exactly how may they be reached?"</p>
    <p>We shall offer proof of the soundness of some of the more important statements made in this book or at least we
        shall offer evidence through which you may secure your own proof through experimentation, and in doing so, we
        shall answer both of these questions.</p>
    <h2>"GENIUS" IS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE SIXTH SENSE</h2>
    <p>The reality of a "sixth sense" has been fairly well established. This sixth sense is "Creative Imagination." The
        faculty of creative imagination is one which the majority of people never use during an entire lifetime, and if
        used at all, it usually happens by mere accident. A relatively small number of people use, WITH DELIBERATION AND
        PURPOSE AFORETHOUGHT, the faculty of creative imagination. Those who use this faculty voluntarily, and with
        understanding of its functions, are GENII.</p>
    <p>The faculty of creative imagination is the direct link between the finite mind of man and Infinite Intelligence.
        All so-called revelations, referred to in the realm of religion, and all discoveries of basic or new principles
        in the field of invention, take place through the faculty of creative imagination.</p>
    <p>When ideas or concepts flash into one's mind, through what is popularly called a "hunch," they come from one or
        more of the following sources:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Infinite Intelligence.</li>
        <li>One's subconscious mind, wherein is stored every sense impression and thought impulse which ever reached the
            brain through any of the five senses.</li>
        <li>From the mind of some other person who has just released the thought, or picture of the idea or concept,
            through conscious thought.</li>
        <li>From the other person's subconscious storehouse.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are no other KNOWN sources from which "inspired" ideas or "hunches" may be received.</p>
    <p>The creative imagination functions best when the mind is vibrating (due to some form of mind stimulation) at an
        exceedingly high rate. That is, when the mind is functioning at a rate of vibration higher than that of
        ordinary, normal thought.</p>
    <p>When brain action has been stimulated, through one or more of the ten mind stimulants, it has the effect of
        lifting the individual far above the horizon of ordinary thought, and permits him to envision distance, scope,
        and quality of THOUGHTS not available on the lower plane, such as that occupied while one is engaged in the
        solution of the problems of business and professional routine.</p>
    <p>When lifted to this higher level of thought, through any form of mind stimulation, an individual occupies,
        relatively, the same position as one who has ascended in an airplane to a height from which he may see over and
        beyond the horizon line which limits his vision, while on the ground. Moreover, while on this higher level of
        thought, the individual is not hampered or bound by any of the stimuli which circumscribe and limit his vision
        while wrestling with the problems of gaining the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. He is
        in a world of thought in which the ORDINARY, work-a-day thoughts have been as effectively removed as are the
        hills and valleys and other limitations of physical vision, when he rises in an airplane.</p>
    <p>While on this exalted plane of THOUGHT, the creative faculty of the mind is given freedom for action. The way has
        been cleared for the sixth sense to function, it becomes receptive to ideas which could not reach the individual
        under any other circumstances. The "sixth sense" is the faculty which marks the difference between a genius and
        an ordinary individual.</p>
    <p>The creative faculty becomes more alert and receptive to vibrations, originating outside the individual's
        subconscious mind, the more this faculty is used, and the more the individual relies upon it, and makes demands
        upon it for thought impulses. This faculty can be cultivated and developed only through use.</p>
    <p>That which is known as one's "conscience" operates entirely through the faculty of the sixth sense.</p>
    <p>The great artists, writers, musicians, and poets become great, because they acquire the habit of relying upon the
        "still small voice" which speaks from within, through the faculty of creative imagination. It is a fact well
        known to people who have "keen" imaginations that their best ideas come through so-called "hunches."</p>
    <p>There is a great orator who does not attain to greatness, until he closes his eyes and begins to rely entirely
        upon the faculty of Creative Imagination. When asked why he closed his eyes just before the climaxes of his
        oratory, he replied, "I do it, because, then I speak through ideas which come to me from within."</p>
    <p>One of America's most successful and best known financiers followed the habit of closing his eyes for two or
        three minutes before making a decision.</p>
    <p>When asked why he did this, he replied, "With my eyes closed, I am able to draw upon a source of superior
        intelligence."</p>
    <p>The late Dr. Elmer R. Gates, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, created more than 200 useful patents, many of them basic,
        through the process of cultivating and using the creative faculty. His method is both significant and
        interesting to one interested in attaining to the status of genius, in which category Dr. Gates, unquestionably
        belonged. Dr. Gates was one of the really great, though less publicized scientists of the world.</p>
    <p>In his laboratory, he had what he called his "personal communication room." It was practically sound proof, and
        so arranged that all light could be shut out. It was equipped with a small table, on which he kept a pad of
        writing paper. In front of the table, on the wall, was an electric pushbutton, which controlled the lights. When
        Dr. Gates desired to draw upon the forces available to him through his Creative Imagination, he would go into
        this room, seat himself at the table, shut off the lights, and CONCENTRATE upon the KNOWN factors of the
        invention on which he was working, remaining in that position until ideas began to "flash" into his mind in
        connection with the UNKNOWN factors of the invention.</p>
    <p>On one occasion, ideas came through so fast that he was forced to write for almost three hours. When the thoughts
        stopped flowing, and he examined his notes, he found they contained a minute description of principles which had
        not a parallel among the known data of the scientific world.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the answer to his problem was intelligently presented in those notes. In this manner Dr. Gates
        completed over 200 patents, which had been begun, but not completed, by "half-baked" brains. Evidence of the
        truth of this statement is in the United States Patent Office.</p>
    <p>Dr. Gates earned his living by "sitting for ideas" for individuals and corporations. Some of the largest
        corporations in America paid him substantial fees, by the hour, for "sitting for ideas."</p>
    <p>The reasoning faculty is often faulty, because it is largely guided by one's accumulated experience. Not all
        knowledge, which one accumulates through "experience," is accurate. Ideas received through the creative faculty
        are much more reliable, for the reason that they come from sources more reliable than any which are available to
        the reasoning faculty of the mind.</p>
    <p>The major difference between the genius and the ordinary "crank" inventor, may be found in the fact that the
        genius works through his faculty of creative imagination, while the "crank" knows nothing of this faculty. The
        scientific inventor (such as Mr. Edison, and Dr. Gates), makes use of both the synthetic and the creative
        faculties of imagination.</p>
    <p>For example, the scientific inventor, or "genius," begins an invention by organizing and combining the known
        ideas, or principles accumulated through experience, through the synthetic faculty (the reasoning faculty). If
        he finds this accumulated knowledge to be insufficient for the completion of his invention, he then draws upon
        the sources of knowledge available to him through his creative faculty. The method by which he does this varies
        with the individual, but this is the sum and substance of his procedure:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>HE STIMULATES HIS MIND SO THAT IT VIBRATES ON A HIGHER-THAN-AVERAGE PLANE, using one or more of the ten mind
            stimulants or some other stimulant of his choice.</li>
        <li>HE CONCENTRATES upon the known factors (the finished part) of his invention, and creates in his mind a
            perfect picture of unknown factors (the unfinished part), of his invention. He holds this picture in mind
            until it has been taken over by the subconscious mind, then relaxes by clearing his mind of ALL thought, and
            waits for his answer to "flash" into his mind.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Sometimes the results are both definite and immediate. At other times, the results are negative, depending upon
        the state of development of the "sixth sense," or creative faculty.</p>
    <p>Mr. Edison tried out more than 10,000 different combinations of ideas through the synthetic faculty of his
        imagination before he "tuned in" through the creative faculty, and got the answer which perfected the
        incandescent light. His experience was similar when he produced the talking machine.</p>
    <p>There is plenty of reliable evidence that the faculty of creative imagination exists. This evidence is available
        through accurate analysis of men who have become leaders in their respective callings, without having had
        extensive educations. Lincoln was a notable example of a great leader who achieved greatness, through the
        discovery, and use of his faculty of creative imagination. He discovered, and began to use this faculty as the
        result of the stimulation of love which he experienced after he met Anne Rutledge, a statement of the highest
        significance, in connection with the study of the source of genius.</p>
    <p>The pages of history are filled with the records of great leaders whose achievements may be traced directly to
        the influence of women who aroused the creative faculties of their minds, through the stimulation of sex desire.
        Napoleon Bonaparte was one of these. When inspired by his first wife, Josephine, he was irresistible and
        invincible. When his "better judgment" or reasoning faculty prompted him to put Josephine aside, he began to
        decline. His defeat and St. Helena were not far distant.</p>
    <p>If good taste would permit, we might easily mention scores of men, well known to the American people, who climbed
        to great heights of achievement under the stimulating influence of their wives, only to drop back to destruction
        AFTER money and power went to their heads, and they put aside the old wife for a new one. Napoleon was not the
        only man to discover that sex influence, <em>from the right source</em>, is more powerful than any substitute of
        expediency, which may be created by mere reason.</p>
    <p>The human mind responds to stimulation!</p>
    <p>Among the greatest, and most powerful of these stimuli is the urge of sex. When harnessed and transmuted, this
        driving force is capable of lifting men into that higher sphere of thought which enables them to master the
        sources of worry and petty annoyance which beset their pathway on the lower plane.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, only the genii have made the discovery. Others have accepted the experience of sex urge, without
        discovering one of its major potentialities a fact which accounts for the great number of "others" as compared
        to the limited number of genii.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of refreshing the memory, in connection with the facts available from the biographies of certain
        men, we here present the names of a few men of outstanding achievement, each of whom was known to have been of a
        highly sexed nature. The genius which was their's, undoubtedly found its source of power in transmuted sex
        energy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GEORGE WASHINGTON</li>
        <li>NAPOLEON BONAPARTE</li>
        <li>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</li>
        <li>ABRAHAM LINCOLN</li>
        <li>RALPH WALDO EMERSON</li>
        <li>ROBERT BURNS</li>
        <li>THOMAS JEFFERSON</li>
        <li>ELBERT HUBBARD</li>
        <li>ELBERT H. GARY</li>
        <li>OSCAR WILDE</li>
        <li>WOODROW WILSON</li>
        <li>JOHN H. PATTERSON</li>
        <li>ANDREW JACKSON</li>
        <li>ENRICO CARUSO</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your own knowledge of biography will enable you to add to this list. Find, if you can, a single man, in all
        history of civilization, who achieved outstanding success in any calling, who was not driven by a well developed
        sex nature. </p>
    <p>If you do not wish to rely upon biographies of men not now living, take inventory of those whom you know to be
        men of great achievement, and see if you can find one among them who is not highly sexed.</p>
    <p>Sex energy is the creative energy of all genii. <em>There never has been, and never will be a great leader,
            builder, or artist lacking in this driving force of sex</em>.</p>
    <p>Surely no one will misunderstand these statements to mean that ALL who are highly sexed are genii! Man attains to
        the status of a genius ONLY when, and IF, he stimulates his mind so that it draws upon the forces available,
        through the creative faculty of the imagination. Chief among the stimuli with which this "stepping up" of the
        vibrations may be produced is sex energy. The mere <em>possession</em> of this energy is not sufficient to
        produce a genius. The energy must be <em>transmuted</em> from desire for physical contact, into some
        <em>other</em> form of desire and action, before it will lift one to the status of a genius.
    </p>
    <p>Far from becoming genii, because of great sex desires, the majority of men <em>lower</em> themselves, through
        misunderstanding and misuse of this great force, to the status of the lower animals.</p>
    <h2>WHY MEN SELDOM SUCCEED BEFORE FORTY</h2>
    <p>I discovered, from the analysis of over 25,000 people, that men who succeed in an outstanding way, seldom do so
        before the age of forty, and more often they do not strike their real pace until they are well beyond the age of
        fifty. This fact was so astounding that it prompted me to go into the study of its cause most carefully,
        carrying the investigation over a period of more than twelve years.</p>
    <p>This study disclosed the fact that the major reason why the majority of men who succeed do not begin to do so
        before the age of forty to fifty, is their tendency to DISSIPATE their energies through over indulgence in
        physical expression of the emotion of sex. The majority of men <em>never</em> learn that the urge of sex has
        other possibilities, which far transcend in importance, that of mere physical expression. The majority of those
        who make this discovery, do so <em>after having wasted many years</em> at a period when the sex energy is at its
        height, prior to the age of forty-five to fifty. This usually is followed by noteworthy achievement.</p>
    <p>The lives of many men up to, and sometimes well past the age of forty, reflect a continued dissipation of
        energies, which could have been more profitably turned into better channels. Their finer and more powerful
        emotions are sown wildly to the four winds. Out of this habit of the male, grew the term, "sowing his wild
        oats."</p>
    <p>The desire for sexual expression is by far the strongest and most impelling of all the human emotions, and for
        this very reason this desire, when <em>harnessed and transmuted</em> into action, other than that of physical
        expression, may raise one to the status of a genius.</p>
    <p>One of America's most able business men frankly admitted that his attractive secretary was responsible for most
        of the plans he created. He admitted that her presence lifted him to heights of creative imagination, such as he
        could experience under no other stimulus.</p>
    <p>One of the most successful men in America owes most of his success to the influence of a very charming young
        woman, who has served as his source of inspiration for more than twelve years. Everyone knows the man to whom
        this reference is made, but not everyone knows the REAL SOURCE of his achievements.</p>
    <p>History is not lacking in examples of men who attained to the status of genii, as the result of the use of
        artificial mind stimulants in the form of alcohol and narcotics. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the "Raven" while under
        the influence of liquor, "dreaming dreams that mortal never dared to dream before." James Whitcomb Riley did his
        best writing while under the influence of alcohol. Perhaps it was thus he saw "the ordered intermingling of the
        real and the dream, the mill above the river, and the mist above the stream." Robert Burns wrote best when
        intoxicated, "For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, we'll take a cup of kindness yet, for Auld Lang Syne."</p>
    <p>But let it be remembered that many such men have destroyed themselves in the end. Nature has prepared her own
        potions with which men may safely stimulate their minds so they vibrate on a plane that enables them to tune in
        to fine and rare thoughts which come from no man knows where! No satisfactory substitute for Nature's stimulants
        has ever been found.</p>
    <p>It is a fact well known to psychologists that there is a very close relationship between sex desires and
        spiritual urges a fact which accounts for the peculiar behavior of people who participate in the orgies known as
        religious "revivals," common among the primitive types.</p>
    <p>The world is ruled, and the destiny of civilization is established, by the human emotions. People are influenced
        in their actions, not by reason so much as by "feelings." The creative faculty of the mind is set into action
        entirely by emotions, and <em>not by cold reason</em>. The most powerful of all human emotions is that of sex.
        There are other mind stimulants, some of which have been listed, but no one of them, nor all of them combined,
        can equal the driving power of sex.</p>
    <p>A mind stimulant is any influence which will either temporarily, or permanently, increase the vibrations of
        thought. The ten major stimulants, described, are those most commonly resorted to. Through these sources one may
        commune with Infinite Intelligence, or enter, at will, the storehouse of the subconscious mind, either one's
        own, or that of another person, a procedure <em>which is all there is of genius</em>.</p>
    <p>A teacher, who has trained and directed the efforts of more than 30,000 sales people, made the astounding
        discovery that highly sexed men are the most efficient salesmen. The explanation is, that the factor of
        personality known as "personal magnetism" is nothing more nor less than sex energy. Highly sexed people always
        have a plentiful supply of magnetism. Through cultivation and understanding, this vital force may be drawn upon
        and used to great advantage in the relationships between people. This energy may be communicated to others
        through the following media:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The hand-shake. The touch of the hand indicates, instantly, the presence of magnetism, or the lack of it.
        </li>
        <li>The tone of voice. Magnetism, or sex energy, is the factor with which the voice may be colored, or made
            musical and charming.</li>
        <li>Posture and carriage of the body. Highly sexed people move briskly, and with grace and ease.</li>
        <li>The vibrations of thought. Highly sexed people mix the emotion of sex with their thoughts, or may do so at
            will, and in that way, may influence those around them.</li>
        <li>Body adornment. People who are highly sexed are usually very careful about their personal appearance. They
            usually select clothing of a style becoming to their personality, physique, complexion, etc.</li>
    </ol> When employing salesmen, the more capable sales manager looks for the quality of personal magnetism as the
    <em>first requirement</em> of a salesman. People who lack sex energy will never become enthusiastic nor inspire
    others with enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is one of the most important requisites in salesmanship, no matter what one
    is selling. <p>The public speaker, orator, preacher, lawyer, or salesman who is lacking in sex energy is a "flop,"
        as far as being able to influence others is concerned. Couple with this the fact, that most people can be
        influenced only through an appeal to their emotions, and you will understand the importance of sex energy as a
        part of the salesman's native ability. Master salesmen attain the status of mastery in selling, because they,
        either consciously, or unconsciously, <em>transmute</em> the energy of sex into SALES ENTHUSIASM! In this
        statement may be found a very practical suggestion as to the actual meaning of sex transmutation.</p>
    <p>The salesman who knows how to take his mind off the subject of sex, and direct it in sales effort with as much
        enthusiasm and determination as he would apply to its original purpose, has acquired the art of sex
        transmutation, whether he knows it or not. The majority of salesmen who transmute their sex energy do so without
        being in the least aware of what they are doing, or how they are doing it.</p>
    <p>Transmutation of sex energy calls for more will power than the average person cares to use for this purpose.
        Those who find it difficult to summon will-power sufficient for transmutation, may gradually acquire this
        ability. Though this requires will-power, the reward for the practice is more than worth the effort.</p>
    <p>The entire subject of sex is one with which the majority of people appear to be unpardonably ignorant. The urge
        of sex has been grossly misunderstood, slandered, and burlesqued by the ignorant and the evil minded, for so
        long that the very word sex is seldom used in polite society. Men and women who are known to be blessed yes,
        BLESSED with highly sexed natures, are usually looked upon as being people who will bear watching.</p>
    <p>Instead of being called blessed, they are usually called cursed.</p>
    <p>Millions of people, even in this age of enlightenment, have inferiority complexes which they developed because of
        this false belief that a highly sexed nature is a curse. These statements, of the virtue of sex energy, should
        not be construed as justification for the libertine. The emotion of sex is a virtue ONLY when used
        intelligently, and with discrimination. It may be misused, and often is, to such an extent that it debases,
        instead of enriches, both body and mind. The better use of this power is the burden of this chapter.</p>
    <p>It seemed quite significant to the author, when he made the discovery that practically every great leader, whom
        he had the privilege of analyzing, was a man whose achievements were largely inspired by a woman. In many
        instances, the "woman in the case" was a modest, self-denying wife, of whom the public had heard but little or
        nothing. In a few instances, the source of inspiration has been traced to the "other woman." Perhaps such cases
        may not be entirely unknown to you.</p>
    <p>Intemperance in sex habits is just as detrimental as intemperance in habits of drinking and eating. In this age
        in which we live, an age which began with the world war, intemperance in habits of sex is common. This orgy of
        indulgence may account for the shortage of great leaders. No man can avail himself of the forces of his creative
        imagination, while dissipating them. Man is the only creature on earth which violates Nature's purpose in this
        connection. Every other animal indulges its sex nature in moderation, and with purpose which harmonizes with the
        laws of nature. Every other animal responds to the call of sex only in "season." Man's inclination is to declare
        "open season."</p>
    <p>Every intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through alcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of
        intemperance which destroys the vital organs of the body, including the brain. Not every person knows, however,
        that over indulgence in sex expression may become a habit as destructive and as detrimental to creative effort
        as narcotics or liquor.</p>
    <p>A sex-mad man is not essentially different than a dope-mad man! Both have lost control over their faculties of
        reason and will-power. Sexual overindulgence may not only destroy reason and willpower, but it may also lead to
        either temporary, or permanent insanity. Many cases of hypochondria (imaginary illness) grow out of habits
        developed in ignorance of the true function of sex.</p>
    <p>From these brief references to the subject, it may be readily seen that ignorance on the subject of sex
        transmutation, forces stupendous penalties upon the ignorant on the one hand, and withholds from them equally
        stupendous benefits, on the other.</p>
    <p>Widespread ignorance on the subject of sex is due to the fact that the subject has been surrounded with mystery
        and beclouded by dark silence. The conspiracy of mystery and silence has had the same effect upon the minds of
        young people that the psychology of prohibition had. The result has been increased curiosity, and desire to
        acquire more knowledge on this "verboten" subject; and to the shame of all lawmakers, and most physicians by
        training best qualified to educate youth on that subject information has not been easily available.</p>
    <p>Seldom does an individual enter upon highly creative effort in any field of endeavor before the age of forty. The
        average man reaches the period of his greatest capacity to create between forty and sixty. These statements are
        based upon analysis of thousands of men and women who have been carefully observed. They should be encouraging
        to those who fail to arrive before the age of forty, and to those who become frightened at the approach of "old
        age," around the forty-year mark. The years between forty and fifty are, as a rule, the most fruitful. Man
        should approach this age, not with fear and trembling, but with hope and eager anticipation.</p>
    <p>If you want evidence that most men do not begin to do their best work before the age of forty, study the records
        of the most successful men known to the American people, and you will find it. Henry Ford had not "hit his pace"
        of achievement until he had passed the age of forty. Andrew Carnegie was well past forty before he began to reap
        the reward of his efforts. James J. Hill was still running a telegraph key at the age of forty. His stupendous
        achievements took place after that age. Biographies of American industrialists and financiers are filled with
        evidence that the period from forty to sixty is the most productive age of man.</p>
    <p>Between the ages of thirty and forty, man begins to learn (if he ever learns), the art of sex transmutation.</p>
    <p>This discovery is generally accidental, and more often than otherwise, the man who makes it is totally
        unconscious of his discovery. He may observe that his powers of achievement have increased around the age of
        thirty-five to forty, but in most cases, he is not familiar with the cause of this change; that Nature begins to
        harmonize the emotions of love and sex in the individual, between the ages of thirty and forty, so that he may
        draw upon these great forces, and apply them jointly as stimuli to action.</p>
    <p>Sex, alone, is a mighty urge to action, but its forces are like a cyclone they are often uncontrollable. When the
        emotion of love begins to mix itself with the emotion of sex, the result is calmness of purpose, poise, accuracy
        of judgment, and balance. What person, who has attained to the age of forty, is so unfortunate as to be unable
        to analyze these statements, and to corroborate them by his own experience?</p>
    <p>When driven by his desire to please a woman, based solely upon the emotion of sex, a man may be, and usually is,
        capable of great achievement, but his actions may be disorganized, distorted, and totally destructive. When
        driven by his desire to please a woman, based upon the motive of sex alone, a man may steal, cheat, and even
        commit murder. But when the emotion of LOVE is mixed with the emotion of sex, that same man will guide his
        actions with more sanity, balance, and reason.</p>
    <p>Criminologists have discovered that the most hardened criminals can be reformed through the influence of a
        woman's love. There is no record of a criminal having been reformed solely through the sex influence. These
        facts are well known, but their cause is not. Reformation comes, if at all, through the <em>heart</em>, or the
        emotional side of man, not through his head, or reasoning side. Reformation means, "a change of heart." It does
        not mean a "change of head." A man may, because of reason, make certain changes in his personal conduct to avoid
        the consequences of undesirable effects, but GENUINE REFORMATION comes only through a change of heart through a
        DESIRE to change.</p>
    <p>Love, Romance, and Sex are all emotions capable of driving men to heights of super achievement. Love is the
        emotion which serves as a safety valve, and insures balance, poise, and constructive effort. When combined,
        these three emotions may lift one to an altitude of a genius. There are genii, however, who know but little of
        the emotion of love. Most of them may be found engaged in some form of action which is destructive, or at least,
        not based upon justice and fairness toward others. If good taste would permit, a dozen genii could be named in
        the field of industry and finance, who ride ruthlessly over the rights of their fellow men. They seem totally
        lacking in conscience. The reader can easily supply his own list of such men.</p>
    <p>The emotions are states of mind. Nature has provided man with a "chemistry of the mind" which operates in a
        manner similar to the principles of chemistry of matter. It is a well known fact that, through the aid of
        chemistry of matter, a chemist may create a deadly poison by mixing certain elements, none of which are in
        themselves harmful in the right proportions. The emotions may, likewise, be combined so as to create a deadly
        poison. The emotions of sex and jealousy, when mixed, may turn a person into an insane beast.</p>
    <p>The presence of any one or more of the destructive emotions in the human mind, through the chemistry of the mind,
        sets up a poison which may destroy one's sense of justice and fairness. In extreme cases, the presence of any
        combination of these emotions in the mind may destroy one's reason.</p>
    <p>The road to genius consists of the development, control, and use of sex, love, and romance. Briefly, the process
        may be stated as follows:</p>
    <p>Encourage the presence of these emotions as the dominating thoughts in one's mind, and discourage the presence of
        all the destructive emotions. The mind is a creature of habit. It thrives upon the <em>dominating</em> thoughts
        fed it. Through the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any emotion, and encourage the
        presence of any other. Control of the mind, through the power of will, is not difficult. Control comes from
        persistence, and habit. The secret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any
        negative emotion presents itself in one's mind, it can be transmuted into a positive, or constructive emotion,
        by the simple procedure of changing one's thoughts.</p>
    <p>THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD TO GENIUS THAN THROUGH VOLUNTARY SELF EFFORT! A man may attain to great heights of
        financial or business achievement, solely by the driving force of sex energy, but history is filled with
        evidence that he may, and usually does, carry with him certain traits of character which rob him of the ability
        to either hold, or enjoy his fortune. This is worthy of analysis, thought, and meditation, for it states a
        truth, the knowledge of which may be helpful to women as well as men. Ignorance of this has cost thousands of
        people their privilege of HAPPINESS, even though they possessed riches. </p>
    <p>The emotions of love and sex leave their unmistakable marks upon the features. Moreover, these signs are so
        visible, that all who wish may read them. The man who is driven by the storm of passion, based upon sex desires
        alone, plainly advertises that fact to the entire world, by the expression of his eyes, and the lines of his
        face. The emotion of love, when mixed with the emotion of sex, softens, modifies, and beautifies the facial
        expression. No character analyst is needed to tell you this you may observe it for yourself.</p>
    <p>The emotion of love brings out, and develops, the artistic and the aesthetic nature of man. It leaves its impress
        upon one's very soul, even after the fire has been subdued by time and circumstance.</p>
    <p>Memories of love never pass. They linger, guide, and influence long after the source of stimulation has faded.
        There is nothing new in this. Every person, who has been moved by GENUINE LOVE, knows that it leaves enduring
        traces upon the human heart. The effect of love endures, because love is spiritual in nature. The man who cannot
        be stimulated to great heights of achievement by love, is hopeless he is dead, though he may seem to live.</p>
    <p>Even the memories of love are sufficient to lift one to a higher plane of creative effort. The major force of
        love may spend itself and pass away, like a fire which has burned itself out, but it leaves behind indelible
        marks as evidence that it passed that way. Its departure often prepares the human heart for a still greater
        love.</p>
    <p>Go back into your yesterdays, at times, and bathe your mind in the beautiful memories of past love. It will
        soften the influence of the present worries and annoyances. It will give you a source of escape from the
        unpleasant realities of life, and maybe who knows? your mind will yield to you, during this temporary retreat
        into the world of fantasy, ideas, or plans which may change the entire financial or spiritual status of your
        life.</p>
    <p>If you believe yourself unfortunate, because you have "loved and lost," perish the thought. One who has loved
        truly, can never lose entirely. Love is whimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and transitory. It
        comes when it pleases, and goes away without warning. Accept and enjoy it while it remains, but spend no time
        worrying about its departure. Worry will never bring it back.</p>
    <p>Dismiss, also, the thought that love never comes but once. Love may come and go, times without number, but there
        are no two love experiences which affect one in just the same way. There may be, and there usually is, one love
        experience which leaves a deeper imprint on the heart than all the others, but all love experiences are
        beneficial, except to the person who becomes resentful and cynical when love makes its departure.</p>
    <p>There should be no disappointment over love, and there would be none if people understood the difference between
        the emotions of love and sex. The major difference is that love is spiritual, while sex is biological. No
        experience, which touches the human heart with a spiritual force, can possibly be harmful, except through
        ignorance, or jealousy.</p>
    <p>Love is, without question, life's greatest experience. It brings one into communion with Infinite Intelligence.
        When mixed with the emotions of romance and sex, it may lead one far up the ladder of creative effort. The
        emotions of love, sex, and romance, are sides of the eternal triangle of achievement-building genius. Nature
        creates genii through no other force.</p>
    <p>Love is an emotion with many sides, shades, and colors. The love which one feels for parents, or children is
        quite different from that which one feels for one's sweetheart. The one is mixed with the emotion of sex, while
        the other is not.</p>
    <p>The love which one feels in true friendship is not the same as that felt for one's sweetheart, parents, or
        children, but it, too, is a form of love.</p>
    <p>Then, there is the emotion of love for things inanimate, such as the love of Nature's handiwork. But the most
        intense and burning of all these various kinds of love, is that experienced in the blending of the emotions of
        love and sex. Marriages, not blessed with the eternal affinity of love, properly balanced and proportioned, with
        sex, cannot be happy ones and seldom endure. Love, alone, will not bring happiness in marriage, nor will sex
        alone. When these two beautiful emotions are blended, marriage may bring about a state of mind, closest to the
        spiritual that one may ever know on this earthly plane.</p>
    <p>When the emotion of romance is added to those of love and sex, the obstructions between the finite mind of man
        and Infinite Intelligence are removed. Then a genius has been born!</p>
    <p>What a different story is this, than those usually associated with the emotion of sex. Here is an interpretation
        of the emotion which lifts it out of the commonplace, and makes of it potter's clay in the hands of God, from
        which He fashions all that is beautiful and inspiring. It is an interpretation which would, when properly
        understood, bring harmony out of the chaos which exists in too many marriages. The disharmonies often expressed
        in the form of nagging, may usually be traced to lack of knowledge on the subject of sex. Where love, romance
        and the proper understanding of the emotion and function of sex abide, there is no disharmony between married
        people.</p>
    <p>Fortunate is the husband whose wife understands the true relationship between the emotions of love, sex, and
        romance. When motivated by this holy triumvirate, no form of labor is burdensome, because even the most lowly
        form of effort takes on the nature of a labor of love.</p>
    <p>It is a very old saying that "a man's wife may either make him or break him," but the reason is not always
        understood. The "making" and "breaking" is the result of the wife's understanding, or lack of understanding of
        the emotions of love, sex, and romance.</p>
    <p>Despite the fact that men are polygamous, by the very nature of their biological inheritance, it is true that no
        woman has as great an influence on a man as his wife, unless he is married to a woman totally unsuited to his
        nature. If a woman permits her husband to lose interest in her, and become more interested in other women, it is
        usually because of her ignorance, or indifference toward the subjects of sex, love, and romance. This statement
        presupposes, of course, that genuine love once existed between a man and his wife. The facts are equally
        applicable to a man who permits his wife's interest in him to die.</p>
    <p>Married people often bicker over a multitude of trivialities. If these are analyzed accurately, the real cause of
        the trouble will often be found to be indifference, or ignorance on these subjects.</p>
    <p><em>Man's greatest motivating force is his desire to please woman!</em> The hunter who excelled during
        prehistoric days, before the dawn of civilization, did so, because of his desire to appear great in the eyes of
        woman. Man's nature has not changed in this respect. The "hunter" of today brings home no skins of wild animals,
        but he indicates his desire for her favor by supplying fine clothes, motor cars, and wealth. Man has the same
        desire to please woman that he had before the dawn of civilization. The only thing that has changed, is his
        method of pleasing. Men who accumulate large fortunes, and attain to great heights of power and fame, do so,
        mainly, to satisfy their <em>desire to please women.</em> </p>
    <p>Take women out of their lives, and great wealth would be useless to most men. <em>It is this inherent desire of
            man to please woman, which gives woman the power to make or break a man</em>.</p>
    <p>The woman who understands man's nature and tactfully caters to it, need have no fear of competition from other
        women. Men may be "giants" with indomitable will-power when dealing with other men, but they are easily managed
        by the women of their choice.</p>
    <p>Most men will not admit that they are easily influenced by the women they prefer, because it is in the nature of
        the male to want to be recognized as the stronger of the species. Moreover, the intelligent woman recognizes
        this "manly trait" and very wisely makes no issue of it.</p>
    <p>Some men know that they are being influenced by the women of their choice their wives, sweethearts, mothers or
        sisters but they tactfully refrain from rebelling against the influence because they are intelligent enough to
        know that NO MAN IS HAPPY OR COMPLETE WITHOUT THE MODIFYING INFLUENCE OF THE RIGHT WOMAN. The man who does not
        recognize this important truth deprives himself of the power which has done more to help men achieve success
        than all other forces combined.</p>
